# Symbl

This contains the submission for the task given by Symbl.ai 

-> The api provided in the submissio didn't work, that is why I chose an alternative api endpoint [Alternate Endpoint](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts). This returns a Json object with the data field containing the title, id and body. 

I represented the body field in the form of Quotes in a card display.

What I did => Fetch an Api endpoint with the relevant data and then display the data using some css formatting.
